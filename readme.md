# Metric 


1. **Classification Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, KNN, Neural Networks)**:
   - **Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly predicted observations to the total observations. High accuracy means more correct predictions.
   - **Precision**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. High precision relates to the low false positive rate.
   - **Recall (Sensitivity)**: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all observations in the actual class. High recall indicates most of the positive cases are correctly recognized.
   - **F1 Score**: The weighted average of Precision and Recall. Useful when you need to balance Precision and Recall.
   - **AUC-ROC**: Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve. Tells how much the model is capable of distinguishing between classes. Higher the AUC, the better the model.

2. **Regression Algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest for Regression, Gradient Boosting & XGBoost for Regression)**:
   - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of the absolute differences between the forecasted and actual values. Lower MAE indicates better accuracy.
   - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of the squares of the differences between the forecasted and actual values. Lower MSE indicates better accuracy but is sensitive to outliers.
   - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the MSE. It is more sensitive to outliers than MAE.
   - **R-squared**: Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables. Closer to 1 indicates better model performance.

3. **Clustering Algorithms (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering)**:
   - **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A high silhouette score indicates the object is well matched to its own cluster and poorly matched to neighboring clusters.
   - **Davies-Bouldin Index**: The average 'similarity' between clusters, where similarity is a measure that compares the distance between clusters with the size of the clusters themselves. Lower values indicate better clustering.

4. **Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)**:
   - **Explained Variance**: Indicates the proportion of the dataset's variance that lies along each principal component. Higher values mean more variance is captured by that principal component.

# Example 

Calculating accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for multiclass problems involves considering each class separately and then averaging the results. Let's go through each metric with an example.

Assume we have a classification problem with three classes (A, B, C), and we've got the following confusion matrix from our predictions:

| True\Predicted | A   | B   | C   |
| -------------- | --- | --- | --- |
| **A**          | 25  | 5   | 2   |
| **B**          | 3   | 30  | 6   |
| **C**          | 1   | 4   | 20  |

### Accuracy
Accuracy is the simplest metric and is calculated as the total number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.

**Formula:**
\[ \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Number of Predictions}} \]

**Calculation:**
\[ \text{Accuracy} = \frac{25 + 30 + 20}{(25+5+2)+(3+30+6)+(1+4+20)} \]

### Precision
Precision for each class is the number of true positives (the diagonal element) divided by the total number of elements predicted as that class (column sum).

**Formula for Class A:**
\[ \text{Precision(A)} = \frac{\text{True Positives (A)}}{\text{Total Predicted as A}} \]
\[ = \frac{25}{25+3+1} \]

Do the same for classes B and C, then average the precision for all classes.

### Recall
Recall for each class is the number of true positives divided by the total number of elements actually belonging to that class (row sum).

**Formula for Class A:**
\[ \text{Recall(A)} = \frac{\text{True Positives (A)}}{\text{Total Actual A}} \]
\[ = \frac{25}{25+5+2} \]

Do the same for classes B and C, then average the recall for all classes.

### F1 Score
The F1 Score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. Calculate it for each class and then average.

**Formula for Class A:**
\[ \text{F1 Score(A)} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision(A)} \times \text{Recall(A)}}{\text{Precision(A)} + \text{Recall(A)}} \]

Repeat this for classes B and C and average the results.

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical representation used to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model. It illustrates the diagnostic ability of the classifier by plotting the True Positive Rate (TPR) against the False Positive Rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The ROC curve is particularly useful for determining the optimal trade-off between sensitivity (true positive rate) and specificity (1 - false positive rate).

### Components of the ROC Curve:

1. **True Positive Rate (TPR)**: Also known as sensitivity, recall, or hit rate. It measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified.
   \[ TPR = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives + False Negatives}} \]

2. **False Positive Rate (FPR)**: Measures the proportion of actual negatives that are incorrectly classified as positives.
   \[ FPR = \frac{\text{False Positives}}{\text{False Positives + True Negatives}} \]

### Interpreting the ROC Curve:

- **The Area Under the Curve (AUC)**: This is a single number summary of the ROC curve. An AUC of 1 represents a perfect classifier, whereas an AUC of 0.5 represents a worthless classifier (no better than random guessing). An AUC between 0.5 and 1 indicates varying degrees of usefulness.

- **Shape of the Curve**: A curve closer to the top-left corner indicates a more accurate test, meaning a higher true positive rate and a lower false positive rate. A curve that approaches the 45-degree diagonal line of the ROC space is less accurate.

- **Threshold Selection**: The ROC curve can also be used for choosing an optimal threshold for decision-making. Different thresholds will give different FPRs and TPRs. The choice depends on the specific cost/benefit trade-off in misclassifying the positive and negative cases. For instance, in medical testing, missing a disease (false negative) might be more critical than a false alarm (false positive).

### Application:

The ROC curve is widely used in medical decision making, radiology, biometrics, and various fields of machine learning and data science. It's particularly valuable when the cost of false positives and false negatives are different, and you need to balance these outcomes.

# Descriptive Stats

Certainly! Descriptive statistics provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. Here are the key formulas:

1. **Measures of Central Tendency**:
   - **Mean (Average)**: \bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i}{n} $$
     where $x_i$ 
     represents each value in the dataset, and \( n \) is the number of values.
     
   - **Median**: 
     - If \( n \) is odd: the middle value of the ordered dataset.
     - If \( n \) is even: the average of the two middle values of the ordered dataset.

   - **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value in the dataset. There can be more than one mode.

2. **Measures of Spread (Variability)**:
   - **Range**: 
     \[ \text{Range} = \text{Max}(x_i) - \text{Min}(x_i) \]

   - **Variance**: 
     \[ s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1} \]
     for a sample, and 
     \[ \sigma^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2}{n} \]
     for a population.

   - **Standard Deviation**:
     \[ s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})^2}{n-1}} \]
     for a sample, and 
     \[ \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \mu)^2}{n}} \]
     for a population.

   - **Interquartile Range (IQR)**:
     \[ \text{IQR} = Q3 - Q1 \]
     where \( Q1 \) and \( Q3 \) are the first and third quartiles, respectively.

3. **Measures of Position**:
   - **Quartiles**: Values that divide the dataset into four equal parts.
   - **Percentiles**: Values that divide the dataset into 100 equal parts.

4. **Measures of Shape**:
   - **Skewness**: Indicates the degree of asymmetry of a distribution around its mean.
   - **Kurtosis**: Measures the 'tailedness' of the probability distribution.

5. **Count**: The number of observations in the dataset.

6. **Sum**: The total sum of all data values.
   \[ \text{Sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i \]

7. **Percentile** 
    \[ P_k = \left( \frac{k}{100} \right) (n + 1) \]

    where:
    - \( P_k \) is the \( k \)-th percentile (the value below which a given percentage of observations fall).
    - \( k \) is the desired percentile (a number between 0 and 100).
    - \( n \) is the number of observations in the dataset.

    After calculating the position using this formula, you might not get a whole number. If the position is not an integer, you interpolate between the closest ranks.

    ### Example:
    Suppose you have a dataset: [4, 1, 7, 2, 6], and you want to find the 30th percentile.

    1. First, sort the dataset: [1, 2, 4, 6, 7].
    2. Calculate the position: \( P_{30} = \left( \frac{30}{100} \right) (5 + 1) = 1.8 \).
    3. Since 1.8 is not a whole number, interpolate between the 1st and 2nd values in the sorted set: 
    - The 1st value is 1 and the 2nd value is 2.
    - Find the 0.8 fraction between 1 and 2: \( 1 + 0.8 \times (2 - 1) = 1.8 \).

    So, the 30th percentile of this dataset is 1.8.

Multiple linear regression and multiple logistic regression are both statistical methods used for prediction and analysis, but they have different purposes and interpretations. Here's a comparison:

### Multiple Linear Regression:
1. **Purpose**: Used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on two or more independent variables.
2. **Model Form**: The relationship is modeled as a linear combination of the independent variables.
   \[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_nX_n + \varepsilon \]
   where \( Y \) is the dependent variable, \( X_1, X_2, ..., X_n \) are independent variables, \( \beta_0 \) is the intercept, \( \beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_n \) are the coefficients for each independent variable, and \( \varepsilon \) is the error term.
3. **Output Interpretation**: The output is a real number, which can be any value within the range of the dependent variable.
4. **Assumptions**: Includes assumptions like linearity, independence, homoscedasticity (constant variance of errors), and normality of errors.
5. **Use Case Example**: Predicting a house’s sale price based on its size, location, and age.

### Multiple Logistic Regression:
1. **Purpose**: Used for binary classification, predicting the probability that a dependent variable belongs to a certain category, based on two or more independent variables.
2. **Model Form**: The probability of the outcome is modeled using a logistic function.
   \[ \log\left(\frac{P}{1 - P}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_nX_n \]
   where \( P \) is the probability of the dependent variable being in a particular class.
3. **Output Interpretation**: The output is a probability value between 0 and 1, often interpreted as the likelihood of belonging to a particular class.
4. **Assumptions**: Similar to linear regression but also assumes a binomial distribution of the dependent variable and the logit link between dependent and independent variables.
5. **Use Case Example**: Predicting whether a loan application will be approved or denied based on the applicant's credit score, income, and employment history.

### Key Differences:
- **Nature of Dependent Variable**: Linear regression is used for continuous variables, whereas logistic regression is for binary (or categorical) dependent variables.
- **Model Output**: Linear regression predicts a quantitative outcome, while logistic regression predicts the probability of an event occurring.
- **Interpretation of Coefficients**: In linear regression, coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in an independent variable. In logistic regression, they represent the change in the log-odds of the dependent variable for a unit change in the independent variable.

Interpreting coefficients in linear and logistic regression and conducting hypothesis tests on them are fundamental aspects of regression analysis. Here's how to interpret these coefficients and test hypotheses:

### Linear Regression Coefficients:
1. **Interpretation**: In a linear regression model \( Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + ... + \beta_nX_n \), the coefficient \( \beta_i \) (where \( i \) is any of the independent variables \( X_i \)) represents the expected change in the dependent variable \( Y \) for a one-unit increase in \( X_i \), holding all other variables constant.
2. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: \( \beta_i = 0 \) (i.e., \( X_i \) has no effect on \( Y \)).
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: \( \beta_i \neq 0 \) (i.e., \( X_i \) does have an effect on \( Y \)).
   - **Test Statistic**: Typically, a t-test is used to test this hypothesis.
   - **P-Value**: If the p-value is less than the significance level (commonly 0.05), reject H0, indicating that \( X_i \) has a statistically significant effect on \( Y \).

### Logistic Regression Coefficients:
1. **Interpretation**: In a logistic regression model \( \log\left(\frac{P}{1 - P}\right) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + ... + \beta_nX_n \), the coefficient \( \beta_i \) represents the change in the log odds of the dependent variable being in a particular category for a one-unit increase in \( X_i \), holding all other variables constant. To interpret in terms of odds, exponentiate the coefficient: \( e^{\beta_i} \).
   - **If \( e^{\beta_i} > 1 \)**: The odds increase as \( X_i \) increases.
   - **If \( e^{\beta_i} < 1 \)**: The odds decrease as \( X_i \) increases.
2. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - **Null Hypothesis (H0)**: \( \beta_i = 0 \) (i.e., \( X_i \) has no effect on the odds).
   - **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: \( \beta_i \neq 0 \) (i.e., \( X_i \) does have an effect on the odds).
   - **Test Statistic**: Similar to linear regression, a Wald test is commonly used.
   - **P-Value**: If the p-value is less than the chosen significance level, reject H0, suggesting that \( X_i \) has a statistically significant effect on the log odds.

### Key Points:
- **Linear Regression**: Coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable per unit change in the independent variable.
- **Logistic Regression**: Coefficients represent the change in the log odds per unit change in the independent variable; exponentiating these coefficients gives the odds ratio.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: In both types of regression, hypothesis testing is used to determine if the independent variables significantly predict the dependent variable.

Proper interpretation of these coefficients is crucial for understanding the relationship between variables in your model. Additionally, hypothesis testing helps determine the statistical significance of these relationships.

Simple linear regression and ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) are fundamental statistical techniques used to analyze relationships between variables. Here's a basic overview of both:

### Simple Linear Regression:
Simple linear regression is used to model the relationship between two variables. It involves finding a linear equation that best fits the data.

**Model**: The simple linear regression model is represented as:
\[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \varepsilon \]
where:
- \( Y \) is the dependent variable.
- \( X \) is the independent variable.
- \( \beta_0 \) is the y-intercept.
- \( \beta_1 \) is the slope of the line.
- \( \varepsilon \) is the error term.

**Coefficient Estimation**:
- **Slope (\( \beta_1 \))**: 
  \[ \beta_1 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2} \]
- **Intercept (\( \beta_0 \))**:
  \[ \beta_0 = \bar{Y} - \beta_1\bar{X} \]
  where \( \bar{X} \) and \( \bar{Y} \) are the means of \( X \) and \( Y \), respectively.

### ANOVA in the Context of Regression:
ANOVA is used to assess the significance of the regression model. In simple linear regression, ANOVA tests whether the model is significantly better at predicting the dependent variable than using the mean of the dependent variable alone.

**ANOVA Table Components**:
1. **Sum of Squares Total (SST)**: Total variation in \( Y \), given by the sum of squared differences from the mean of \( Y \).
   \[ SST = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \bar{Y})^2 \]
2. **Sum of Squares Regression (SSR)**: Variation explained by the regression line.
   \[ SSR = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{Y}_i - \bar{Y})^2 \]
   where \( \hat{Y}_i \) are the predicted values.
3. **Sum of Squares Error (SSE)**: Unexplained variation.
   \[ SSE = SST - SSR \] 
   or 
   \[ SSE = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2 \]

**Degrees of Freedom**:
- **Regression**: \( df_{regression} = 1 \) (since it's a simple linear regression with one predictor)
- **Error**: \( df_{error} = n - 2 \) (number of observations minus the number of estimated parameters)

**Mean Squares**:
- **Mean Square Regression (MSR)**: \( MSR = \frac{SSR}{df_{regression}} \)
- **Mean Square Error (MSE)**: \( MSE = \frac{SSE}{df_{error}} \)

**F-Statistic**:
- **F-value**: \( F = \frac{MSR}{MSE} \)
  This value is compared against a critical value from the F-distribution with \( df_{regression} \) and \( df_{error} \) degrees of freedom to determine if the regression model fits the data better than the mean alone.

ANOVA in regression analysis provides a way to test the overall significance of the model. If the F-statistic is significantly large, it suggests that the regression model provides a better fit to the data than a model with no independent variables.

In simple linear regression, where the model is defined as \( Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \varepsilon \), the variances of the estimated coefficients \(\hat{\beta}_0\) (the intercept) and \(\hat{\beta}_1\) (the slope) are important for understanding the precision of these estimates. These variances are derived from the properties of the least squares estimators.

### Variance of \( \hat{\beta}_1 \) (Slope)
The variance of the slope coefficient \(\hat{\beta}_1\) in simple linear regression is given by:

\[ \text{Var}(\hat{\beta}_1) = \frac{\sigma^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2} \]

Here:
- \( \sigma^2 \) is the variance of the error term (\(\varepsilon\)).
- \( X_i \) are the individual values of the independent variable.
- \( \bar{X} \) is the mean of the independent variable \( X \).
- \( n \) is the number of observations.

### Variance of \( \hat{\beta}_0 \) (Intercept)
The variance of the intercept \(\hat{\beta}_0\) is a bit more complex and is given by:

\[ \text{Var}(\hat{\beta}_0) = \sigma^2 \left( \frac{1}{n} + \frac{\bar{X}^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X})^2} \right) \]

### Estimating \( \sigma^2 \)
In practice, \( \sigma^2 \) (the variance of the error term) is unknown and must be estimated from the data. This is typically done using the Mean Square Error (MSE) from the regression output, which is an unbiased estimator of \( \sigma^2 \):

\[ \hat{\sigma}^2 = \text{MSE} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (Y_i - \hat{Y}_i)^2}{n - 2} \]

where \( \hat{Y}_i \) are the predicted values from the regression.

### Application
These variance formulas are used to calculate the standard errors of the coefficients (\(\hat{\beta}_0\) and \(\hat{\beta}_1\)), which in turn are used to construct confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests about the coefficients. The square roots of these variances give the standard errors:

- Standard Error of \( \hat{\beta}_1 \): \( \text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_1) = \sqrt{\text{Var}(\hat{\beta}_1)} \)
- Standard Error of \( \hat{\beta}_0 \): \( \text{SE}(\hat{\beta}_0) = \sqrt{\text{Var}(\hat{\beta}_0)} \)

## Stats Aj Yuwadee 

"Causation" and "Correlation" are two fundamental concepts in statistics and research methodology, often confused or misunderstood.

- **Correlation**: This implies a relationship or a connection between two or more variables. When two variables are correlated, it means that they tend to vary together. If one goes up, the other one often goes up too (positive correlation), or down (negative correlation). However, correlation does not imply that one variable causes the other to change. It only indicates that there's a link or association between the two.

- **Causation**: This indicates that one event is the result of the occurrence of the other event; there is a cause-and-effect relationship. If A causes B, then A is the cause and B is the effect. Establishing causation means more than just finding a correlation; it requires showing that changes in one variable are directly responsible for changes in the other.

The classic adage "correlation does not imply causation" means just because two variables are correlated does not mean one causes the other. For example, ice cream sales might be correlated with drowning deaths, but eating ice cream does not cause drowning; both are likely related to a third factor, like hot weather. 

Causation typically requires establishing three things:

1. **Correlation**: The cause and effect are correlated.
2. **Temporal Precedence**: The cause comes before the effect.
3. **No Confounding Variables**: There are no other plausible explanations or variables causing the effect. 

Researchers use various methods, including controlled experiments, longitudinal studies, and statistical controls, to try to establish causation rather than mere correlation.
